For this problem, I simulated the inheritance of blood types for a family.

This problem required the implementation of the following functions:

- create_family
- free_family

This is my solution of the CS50 inheritance lab, using C. https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/labs/5/ This problem set required implemnetation of a program which spell-checks a file (from a list of words, i.e. the dictionaries provided by CS50).

This was produced as a part of CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science. Uploading of my solution to Github is considered to be reasonable regarding the academic honesty policy. (https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/63235w/is_this_reasonable/)
